Greetings, I am a CS graduate from the School of Computer Science at XIM University. Recently, I worked as a researcher in a sponsored Research project 'PAST: Predictor and Analyzer of Security Threats' at BITS Pilani, Goa. I extend a warm welcome to you as you peruse my portfolio. My primary area of specialization lies within the field of AI-driven threat analysis, where I have dedicated significant time and effort to honing my expertise. Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio; I trust it will offer valuable insights into my accomplishments.

**Research Statement**

I feel compelled to convey the trajectory of my academic journey, research aspirations, and commitment to advancing Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the field of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) security. My academic interests have always been rooted in understanding complex systems and solving intricate, real-world problems. During my undergraduate studies, my thesis, titled "Rumor Detection using Deep Learning Techniques," marked my initial foray into applied AI research, wherein I developed an end-to-end framework for early rumor detection on social media. This work not only demonstrated AI's potential in addressing pressing societal issues but also reinforced my desire to pursue AI-focused research.

My interest in CPS security crystallized during my first research fellowship in 2023, where I began exploring the intersection of AI, Machine Learning (ML), and cyber-physical environments. This research allowed me to examine the nuanced dynamics of CPS, in which the convergence of physical, computational, and communication elements presents both intricate challenges and promising opportunities for intelligent systems. In the course of my research, I led the development of an automated toolchain that parses log files, generates Petri Net models through the $\alpha$-algorithm, and applies perturbations to these models to simulate potential attacker actions. This work culminated in a comprehensive e-commerce case study, leading to a peer-reviewed publication at the 16th International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks. Expanding upon this, I initiated a project aimed at proactively detecting cyber threats in digital infrastructure through attack graph modeling. Leveraging deep learning, I developed a method to predict feasible links in an Attack Graph by integrating data from multiple cyber threat intelligence sources with process mining techniques. This model employs Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to highlight behavioral patterns affecting digital infrastructures, enabling the prediction of probable attack paths. The findings were accepted for presentation at the 29th IEEE Pacific Rim International Symposium on Dependable Computing (PRDC 2024).

Looking ahead, I am dedicated to advancing research in the security of CPS using AI. My proposed research aims to develop robust AI-driven models for preemptive security in CPS, focusing on anomaly detection, real-time threat assessment, and the secure orchestration of interconnected systems. Through a combination of deep learning methodologies, probabilistic reasoning, and system-level modeling, I intend to design scalable frameworks capable of addressing the unique security challenges that arise in interdisciplinary CPS applications. This research promises to make meaningful contributions to AI-driven CPS security, bridging theoretical advancements with practical, resilient solutions for the digital infrastructures of tomorrow.
