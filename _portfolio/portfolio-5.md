title: "HR Planes"
excerpt: "Designed a novel object detection model to automatically detect airplanes in high-resolution satellite images, using Google Earth ismagery under various landscape, seasonal, and satellite geometry conditions. The dataset was evaluated using two state-of-the-art object detection methods. Incorporated advanced techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, optimization algorithm, and data augmentation to improve model precision. Attained excellent accuracy of 80.27% with training. Intended to accomplish reliable and accurate airplane detection capabilities. <br/><img src='/images/HRPlanes.png' style='width:50%;'>"
