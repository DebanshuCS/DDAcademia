The widespread adoption of e-commerce and its lucrative, decentralized, multi-agent nature have made these systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Traditional signature-based approaches have been successful in detecting instances of fraud, however continues to struggle against unknown attacks. To this end, we present PALM, a framework that effectively integrate contextual knowledge on known vulnerabilities and threats with data-oriented process-aware approaches to build a comprehensive graph-structure-based model. Graph Convolution Network is then employed to look for malicious feature correlations and information flows, indicating a likelihood of link between un-connected neighboring nodes. Using a sample event log, we test the efficacy of our framework, achieving 83.33% accuracy and an AUC-ROC of 0.9186, signifying its potential in identifying novel attack paths.
