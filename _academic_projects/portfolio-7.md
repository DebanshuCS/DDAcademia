title: "DeepRumor"
excerpt: "I researched an end-to-end framework for early rumor detection on social media using deep learning techniques. By leveraging a range of algorithms, including weak supervision, I was able to address key bottlenecks in previous rumor detection systems. My work resulted in significant improvements in state-of-the-art performance for early rumor detection."
