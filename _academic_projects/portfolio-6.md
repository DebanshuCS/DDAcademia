title: "TransLingua"
excerpt: "This enthralling project involves constructing a neural machine translation model with large-scale parallel corpora by using an intuitive method, sequence-to-sequence learning approach consisting encoder-decoder LSTMs(Long Short-Term Memory) network architecture, RNN(Recurrent Neural Network) and word embedding. The model secured an outstanding translation accuracy along with minimizing the loss function eminently."
